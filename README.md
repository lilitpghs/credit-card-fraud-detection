# Credit Card Fraud Detection (Imbalanced Classification)

Overview

This project focuses on credit card fraud detection, a real-world machine learning problem defined by extreme class imbalance, asymmetric error costs and the need for model interpretability. Instead of optimizing for accuracy, the project exemines fraud-appropriate metrics, threshold tuning and explainable models, reflecting how fraud systems are built in production environments.
